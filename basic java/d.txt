9. Hints & Tips
=============================================================
BOWLING:

1. Utilise the full range of your bowlers.

2. Vary the pace of the bowling.

3. Vary the spin of the bowling.

4. Medium-Fast and Fast bowlers are good on green pitches.

5. Vary the bowling side between over and around the wicket.

6. When bowling, frequently vary your field setup to defend against 
your opposition's shots.

7. When bowling with Medium-Fast and Fast bowlers in a test match, it 
is good to have three or four slip fielders to catch edges.

8. Patience is a virtue in a test match.

9. Slower bowlers (Spin bowlers) are more effective on dry, dusty, damp and wet 
pitches.

10. Overcast conditions are more condusive to swing movement through the air.

BATTING:

1. Keep an eye on the opponent's fielding positions to exploit the 
gaps.

2. Use practice nets to learn the shots and perfect your timing.

3. In the practice nets, learn every shot so that you can vary your 
shot selection and direction in the game.

4. Remember, patience is a virtue in a test match.

5. Use the Six Hit button early on in One Day Games as the fielders 
have restrictions placed on them during the first 30% of the game.

6. Missing the shot results in a drop in the batsman's confidence 
level.

7. Being hit by the ball results in a significant drop in the batsman's 
confidence level.

8. When first batting, use the run assist function to help judge 
running between the wickets.

9. Utilising the all new 'Analog Batting' system on a supported controller 
is highly recommended for this title.
